# Other Resources

Because UnifyBio is built heavily around the use of
[Datomic](https://docs.datomic.com/datomic-overview.html) and 
[Unify](https://github.com/vendekagon-labs/unify/),
users are encourages to refer to documentation and tutorials for these. We also recommend
perusing resources related to [CANDEL](https://candelbio.github.io/candel-bio-website/),
the project which birthed the tools used in UnifyBio.

## Datomic

It's especially helpful to understand Datomic's datalog query model, even if you
intend to primarily use UnifyBio via SQL integrations like that provided by the
Trino integration, since the mapping from Datomic datoms to SQL results in some
atypical data patterns (though depending on the particular system you're using,
some of these peculiarities might be abstracted away via Views).

Two excellent resources for coming to grips with Datomic datalog quickly are
[Learn Datalog Today](https://www.learndatalogtoday.org/) and
[Max Datom](https://max-datom.com/). For a more thorough introduction, there
are learning materials, slides, and video links available for the Day of Datomic series
in the [official Datomic documentation Day of Datomic topic](https://docs.datomic.com/resources/day-of-datomic.html).
